# Following the white rabbit...

Valentina lives in Sydney but mostly in her head. She thinks the
Harbour Bridge goes alright and the Opera House is ok I guess,
but is pissed off about the rising cost of living and resents
paying money to breathe the air in Sydney.

She believes we are all - at all times - one symposium away from a
bacchanal, one minor inconvenience away from a total breakdown,
and one regression away from complete freedom. Make of that what
you will.

She has too many books, and kindly accepts them as gifts (hint).

Valentina regularly experiences choice paralysis and her academic
and professional experience reflects this. Psychology, policy,
philosophy, archaeology, and film studies are all in there
somewhere, as are criminology and forensic psychology, fashion,
music, and not leaving the house for consecutive days in a row as
an extreme sport.
